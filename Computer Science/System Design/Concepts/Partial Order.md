Mathematical sets are not [[Total Order|totally ordered]]: is $\{a, b\}$ greater then $\{b, c\}$? You can't compare them, because neither is a subset of the other. We say they are ***incomparable***, and therefore mathematical sets are ***partially ordered***: in some cases one set is greater than another (if one contains all of the elements of another), but in other cases they are incomparable.
