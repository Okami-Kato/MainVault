REST is not a protocol, but rather a design philosophy that builds upon the principles of HTTP

It emphasizes simple data formats, using URLs for identifying resources and using HTTP features for cache control, authentication, and content type negotiation.

An API designed according to the principles of REST is called *RESTful*.
