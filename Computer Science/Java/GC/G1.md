# Heap Structure

![[Pasted image 20240509155502.png]]

Region size is chosen by the [[Java Virtual Matchine|JVM]] at startup. The JVM generally targets around 2000 regions varying in size from 1 to 32Mb.

# Heap Allocation
In reality, these regions are mapped into logical representations of Eden, Survivor, and old generation spaces.

![[Pasted image 20240509155618.png]]

The colors in the picture shows which region is associated with which role. Live objects are ***evacuated*** (i.e., copied or moved) from one region to another. Regions are designed to be collected in ***parallel*** with or without stopping all other application threads.

As shown regions can be allocated into ***Eden***, ***survivor***, and ***old generation*** regions. In addition, there is a fourth type of object known as ***Humongous*** regions. These regions are designed to hold objects that are 50% the size of a standard region or larger. They are stored as a set of contiguous regions. Finally the last type of regions would be the unused areas of the heap.

# Young Generation
The heap is split into approximately 2000 regions. Minimum size is 1Mb and maximum size is 32Mb. Blue regions hold old generation objects and green regions hold young generation objects.

Note that the regions are not required to be contiguous like the older garbage collectors.

# Young GC
Live objects are ***evacuated*** (i.e., copied or moved) to one or more survivor regions. If the aging threshold is met, some of the objects are ***promoted*** to old generation regions.

This is a [[Stop The World]] (STW) pause. Eden size and survivor size is calculated for the next young GC. Accounting information is kept to help calculate the size. Things like the pause time goal are taken into consideration.

This approach makes it very easy to resize regions, making them bigger or smaller as needed.

Recently promoted objects are shown in dark blue. Survivor regions in green.

## Summary
- The heap is a single memory space split into regions.
- Young generation memory is composed of a set of non-contiguous regions. This makes it easy to resize when needed.
- Young generation garbage collections, or young GCs, are stop the world events. All application threads are stopped for the operation.
- The young GC is done in parallel using multiple threads.
- Live objects are copied to new survivor or old generation regions.

# Old GC

| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| (1) Initial Mark  <br>*(Stop the World Event)*         | This is a stop the world event. With G1, it is piggybacked on a normal young GC. Mark survivor regions (root regions) which may have references to objects in old generation.                                                                                           |
| (2) Root Region Scanning                               | Scan survivor regions for references into the old generation. This happens while the application continues to run. The phase must be completed before a young GC can occur.                                                                                             |
| (3) Concurrent Marking                                 | Find live objects over the entire heap. This happens while the application is running. This phase can be interrupted by young generation garbage collections.                                                                                                           |
| (4) Remark<br>*(Stop the World Event)*                 | Completes the marking of live object in the heap. Uses an algorithm called [[Snapshot At The Beginning\|snapshot-at-the-beginning]] (SATB) which is much faster than what was used in the CMS collector.                                                                |
| (5) Cleanup<br>*(Stop the World Event and Concurrent)* | - Performs accounting on live objects and completely free regions. (Stop the world)<br>- Scrubs the Remembered Sets. (Stop the world)<br>- Reset the empty regions and return them to the free list. (Concurrent)                                                       |
| (\*) Copying<br>*(Stop the World Event)*               | These are the stop the world pauses to evacuate or copy live objects to new unused regions. This can be done with young generation regions which are logged as `[GC pause (young)]`. Or both young and old generation regions which are logged as `[GC Pause (mixed)]`. |

## Breakdown
___
### Initial Marking Phase
Initial marking of live object is piggybacked on a young generation garbage collection. In the logs this is noted as GC `pause (young)(inital-mark)`.

![[Pasted image 20240509162026.png]]

### Concurrent Marking Phase
If empty regions are found (as denoted by the "X"), they are removed immediately in the Remark phase. Also, "accounting" information that determines liveness is calculated.

![[Pasted image 20240509162054.png]]

### Remark Phase
Empty regions are removed and reclaimed. Region liveness is now calculated for all regions.

![[Pasted image 20240509162112.png]]

### Copying/Cleanup Phase
G1 selects the regions with the lowest "liveness", those regions which can be collected the fastest. Then those regions are collected at the same time as a young GC. This is denoted in the logs asÂ `[GC pause (mixed)]`. So both young and old generations are collected at the same time.

![[Pasted image 20240509162312.png]]

### After Copying/Cleanup Phase
The regions selected have been collected and compacted into the dark blue region and the dark green region shown in the diagram.

# Summary
In summary, there are a few key points we can make about the G1 garbage collection on the old generation.

1) Concurrent Marking Phase
	- Liveness information is calculated concurrently while the application is running.
	- This liveness information identifies which regions will be best to reclaim during an evacuation pause.
	- There is no sweeping phase like in [[Concurrent Mark Sweep|CMS]].
2) Remark Phase
	- Uses the Snapshot-at-the-Beginning (SATB) algorithm which is much faster then what was used with CMS.
	- Completely empty regions are reclaimed.
3) Copying/Cleanup Phase
	- Young generation and old generation are reclaimed at the same time.
	- Old generation regions are selected based on their liveness.
