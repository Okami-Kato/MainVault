Works as follows:
1) One of the [[Replica|replicas]] is designated to be a *leader* (also known as *master* or *primary*). When clients want to write to the database, they must send their requests to the leader, which first writes the new data to its local storage.
2) The other replicas are known as *followers* (*read replicas*, *slaves*, *secondaries*, or *hot standbys*). Whenever the leader writes new data to its local storage, it also sends the data change to all of its followers as part of a [[Replication Log|replication log]] or *change stream*. Each follower takes the log from the leader and updates its local copy of the database accordingly, by applying all writes in the same order as they were processed on the leader.
3) When a client wants to read from the database, it can query either the leader or any of the followers. However, writes are only accepted on the leader (the followers are read-only from the clientâ€™s point of view).
