[[XML]] is often being criticized for being to verbose and unnecessarily complicated.

[[JSON]]'s popularity is mainly due to its built-in support in web browsers (by virtue of being a subset of JavaScript) and simplicity relative to XML

[[CSV]] is another popular language-independent format, albeit less powerful

Good thing is all of them are textual, thus somewhat human-readable formats.

Though they also have subtle problems:
- Ambiguity. XML and CSV don't distinguish numbers and strings that happen to contain numbers. JSON doesn't distinguish integers and floats
- Lack of support for binary strings. Workarounds such as Base64 encoding have to be used in order to pass binary data, which increases the size of payload by ~33%
- Complicated schema formats
- CSV doesn't have any schema and is generally very vague format. What if value contains comma or a newline character? Escaping rules are formally defined, but not all parsers implement them correctly.

Despite these flaws, JSON, XML, and CSV are good enough for many purposes. Itâ€™s
likely that they will remain popular, especially as data interchange formats
