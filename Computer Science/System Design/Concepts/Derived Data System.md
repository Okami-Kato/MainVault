***Derived data system*** is a system that stores data that is the result of taking some existing data from another system and transforming or processing it in some way

If you lose derived data, you can recreate it from the original source.

A classic examples are [[Cache|caches]], denormalized values, [[Index|indexes]] and [[Materialized View|materialized views]]

>Technically speaking, derived data is ***redundant***
