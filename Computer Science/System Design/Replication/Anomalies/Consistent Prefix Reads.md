- Event A comes ***before*** the event B.
- Someone listens to both events through the replicas. 
- First replica receives event B before the second replica receives event A
- Someone sees event B come before event A - ***bad***

Preventing this kind of anomaly requires another type of guarantee: ***consistent prefix reads***

This guarantee says that if a sequence of writes happens in a ***certain order***,
then anyone reading those writes will see them appear in the ***same order***.

This is a particular problem in [[Computer Science/System Design/Partitioning/Partitioning|partitioned (sharded)]] databases

One solution is to make sure that any writes that are causally related to each other are written to the same partitionâ€”but in some applications that cannot be done efficiently. There are also algorithms that explicitly keep track of causal dependencies ([[Capturing The Happens Before Relationship]])
